```

### Google Sheets Setup

This bot uses Google Sheets to record support data. You'll need to set up a Google Service Account to authenticate with Google Sheets API.

#### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project and Service Account

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API" and enable it
4. Create a service account:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service account"
   - Fill in the service account details and create it
5. Generate a key for the service account:
   - Click on the created service account
   - Go to the "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
   - Choose "JSON" format and download the key file

#### Step 2: Extract Credentials

From the downloaded JSON file, extract the following values:

- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The `client_email` field
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`: The `private_key` field (keep the `\n` characters as they are)

#### Step 3: Configure Google Spreadsheet

1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet or use an existing one
2. Copy the spreadsheet ID from the URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`)
3. Share the spreadsheet with your service account email with "Editor" permissions
4. Create three sheets in your spreadsheet with the names specified in your `config.json`:
   - Sheet for `datasheet_init` (default: "init")
   - Sheet for `datasheet_response` (default: "response")
   - Sheet for `datasheet_resolve` (default: "resolve")

#### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

Set the `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` to your spreadsheet ID from step 3.

#### Step 5: Configure Spreadsheet Structure

After creating your spreadsheet, you need to set up the proper structure for data collection:

##### Required Sheets

Create **3 sheets** with these exact names (matching your `config.json`):

1. **"init"** - Main data sheet (tracks all forum posts)
2. **"response"** - First response tracking
3. **"resolve"** - Resolution tracking

##### Sheet Headers Setup

**"init" Sheet (Row 1 Headers):**

```text
post_id | post_link | question | posted_by | posted | tags | responder | first_response | resolution_time | resolved_by
```

**"response" Sheet (Row 1 Headers):**

```text
post_id | first_response | responder
```

**"resolve" Sheet (Row 1 Headers):**

```text
post_id | resolution_time | resolved_by
```

##### Data Flow Overview

| Sheet | When Data is Added | What Gets Recorded |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **init** | New forum post created | Post details, tags, timestamps (formulas auto-link other data) |
| **response** | Support team first responds | Response time and responder username |

##### Analytics Capabilities

Once set up, your spreadsheet will automatically track:

- **Response Times** - How quickly support team responds
- **Resolution Times** - How long issues take to resolve  
- **Team Performance** - Individual support member metrics
- **Popular Topics** - Most common tags and question types
- **Support Workflow** - Complete timeline from post to resolution

The **"init" sheet serves as your main dashboard** with all data connected through formulas, giving you comprehensive support analytics in one view.
